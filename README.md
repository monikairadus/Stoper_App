# Stopwatch

This application allows you to measure time. The stopwatch can be started, paused, stopped and reset using the buttons. There is also an archive button, pressing which shows the history of the results so far. In addition, it is also possible to change the style of the application and the window with the program manual that appears after pressing the button with the help sign.
